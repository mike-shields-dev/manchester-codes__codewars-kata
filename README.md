# codewars-kata

This repo is an exercise from **Programming Fundamentals/Javascript Basics** of the [Manchester Codes](https://www.manchestercodes.com/) **Full Stack Web Development** syllabus. 

The task was to take some previously completed kata from CodeWars and to reimplement the TDD workflow in a repo, 
using Jest. 

The exercise was an opportunity to practice some of the things we have covered in this and previous modules: 

- Initialising a local repo
- Branching locally
- Merging branches
- Making meaningful and logical commits
- Pushing/Publishing to GitHub
- The Test Driven Development Workflow
- Anatomy of JavaScript: variables, functions, statements, expressions, operators, literals etc. 
- Working with data types and the various methods associated with their prototypes.  
- General Problem Solving Skills
- Working with Node/NPM
